          <h1>Interest in mathematics varies by teacher support</h1>
          <p>
            The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an international survey which aims to evaluate the educational systems of the world, by measuring 15 years old studentsâ€™ skills in mathematics, reading, science and problem-solving. As part of the 2012 survey, students answered a background questionnaire, that among many others, contained questions about how supportive the teachers are, and how interested the students are in mathematics. My visualisation aims to show an interesting relationship between these two groups of questions.
