          <h1>Interest in mathematics varies by teacher support</h1>
          <p>
            The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an international survey which aims to evaluate the educational systems of the world. It focuses on testing 15 years old students' skills in mathematics, reading, science and problem-solving, and it also examines how students can use the skills they learned in unfamiliar settings. In 2012, 65 countries and economies took part in the survey. As part of the survey, students also answered a background questionnaire, that contained questions about their home, school, and learning environment. A group of questions concentrated on how supportive the teachers are, and another group on how interested the student are in mathematics. I wanted to know if there is a relationship between the answers students gave to these two groups of questions. What I found, students who felt that their teachers are supportive were also more interested in mathematics. For example, while only 41% of students who felt that their teachers do not give them the opportunity to express opinions answered that they are interested in mathematics, the same proportion was 66% among those who felt otherwise.
