# Interest in mathematics varies by teacher support

## Summary

PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) is an international survey which aims to evaluate the educational systems of the world. As part of the 2012 PISA survey students answered a background questionnaire, that contained questions about their home, school, and learning environment. A group of questions concentrated on how supportive the teachers are, and another group on how interested the student are in mathematics. My visualization shows a relationship between these two groups of questions.
